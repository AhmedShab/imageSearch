## Overview
I'm doing freeCodeCamp challenges and this is part of the backend. In this challenge we were asked to do the following:

User stories:

1) I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.

2) I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.

3) I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.
